## About DashClock

DashClock is a replacement lock screen and home screen clock widget for Android 4.2+. It also exposes additional status items called extensions. The widget comes bundled with extensions that give you instant access to:

 * Your current local weather
 * Missed calls and unread text messages
 * Your next calendar appointment
 * Unread Gmail inbox or priority inbox conversations
 * Your next scheduled alarm


## Extensibility

DashClock is extensible! You can create custom extensions that expose status information using the DashClock [API](https://github.com/romannurik/dashclock/wiki/API).
